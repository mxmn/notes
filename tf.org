* RNN
** Definitions
- =batch_size= is the number of parallel batches
- =state_size= is the number of elements in the states vector of an RNN
- =n_steps= is the number of truncated backprop steps in an RNN
  - should be bigger by a good margin than the maximal time interval to remember
- =n_epochs= is the number of epochs
- =batch_partition_length= = =n_elem= / =batch_size= : length of a batch partition
