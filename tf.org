* RNN

** Definitions
- =batch_size= is the number of parallel batches
- =state_size= is the number of elements in the states vector of an RNN
- =num_steps= is the number of truncated backprop steps in an RNN
  - should be bigger by a good margin than the maximal time interval to remember
- =num_epochs= is the number of epochs
- =epoch_size= is the number of steps in one epoch (=epoch_size = batch_partition_length / num_steps=)
- =num_elems= is the number of elements in one epoch ( =num_elems = epoch_size * batch_size * num_steps= )
- =batch_partition_length = num_elems / batch_size= : length of a batch partition


** Models - Setup
- LSTM store their state n a 2-tuple
- =dynamic_rnn= produces =rnn_outputs= with shape =[batch_size, num_steps, state_size]=

*** Variable Length Sequences
- RNN functions expect tensors of shape =[batch_size, seq_length]=
  where =seq_length= is the lenght of the sequences in the batch.
  - use =dynamic_pad=True= when calling =tf.train.batch= to pad the
    batch automatically with zeros if the sequences are not of the
    same length.
- provide =sequence_length= keyword to =dynamic_rnn=
- the return of =dynamic_rnn= is a tuple of =(outputs, state)=
  - =outputs= is a tensor of shape =[batch_size, seq_length, num_units]=
  - =state= is a tuple of two tensors (=[batch_size, num_units]=)
