# Python Style

See for
[Best of the Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839)
(BOBP) Guide for Python that presents a great summary of coding
practices. As well, don't forget about The Zen of Python
([PEP 20](https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839)) and
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Docstring
conventions are presented in
[PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

- document `__init__` methods in the docstring of the class.
- use comments sparingly. Small methods are often more effective than comments.
- reStructured Text and Sphinx can help to enforce standards.
